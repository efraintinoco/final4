        <p>
              Hello everyone! My name is Efrain Tinoco. Professionally, I have over 20 years of experience with 
              Ford Motor Credit.  I currently supervise a diverse team of 12 CSR’s, 
              which I help train and motivate towards individual and group goals. 
              I ensure daily tasks and functions are completed accurately, timely, and per 
              Company Policy and Procedure. I am a self-starter, and detailed oriented, 
              with great written and verbal communications skills. <br> <br>
              Personally, I am married to a beautiful wife and father of two
              wonderful teenagers. I'm the biggest Dallas Cowboys fan you will ever meet. I was born and raised in Dallas, TX., where I still live, and I am of Mexican-American descent.  I am
              very proud of my culture and think it is important to make sure my kids understand and embrace their heritage. As such, I 
              make it a point to celebrate <a href = "https://www.history.com/topics/halloween/day-of-the-dead" target="_blank"><i> Day of the Dead</i></a> every year. So my kids know the importantance of remembering and honoring our loved
              ones who have passed away.  <br><br>

        <h2><i> Aspiring Software Engineer ! </h2></i>
        <p>
            I’m Interested in a career as a software engineer, 
                  because of the long-term outlook that being a software engineer 
                  presents within the company. 
                  Technology is consistently changing, and as time goes on, keeping up with the 
                  latest software engineering skills becomes even more valuable.   
                  As the company continues to evolve and places an emphasis on
                   “Modernizing Everywhere”, I know software engineering will be front and center, 
                   and in high demand, which can potentially further my career within Ford Motor 
                   Credit.Becoming a software engineer is an 
                  invaluable skill that can open a completely different career path for me,
                 while remaining at Ford Credit. Having worked here for over 20 years, I have 
                 been exploring different options, within the company, that can help me expand
                  my knowledge and contribute to the team in a different way. I think the Learn 
                  to Code program does just that and is a perfect fit for me.
