        For the feedback, I asked two of co-workers, Jose Gonzalez and Nicole Robinson, if they could review the first draft of my website and provide me feedback.
         They are both also Superviors in the CSC Department at Ford Credit, and I have worked with them for over 15 years each. 
         We have worked together on several different projects and we have always been able to be open and honest with each other, 
         so their feedback is something I truly value. <br><br>

     To the right, you will see what my website looked like after I implemented the feedback I received. Overall, I think
                        The feedback provided was spot on. It helped my website look sleeker, and more polished, than it did before the revisions. Overall,
                        I am happy with the way my website has turned out ! To the right you will see what my website looked like after I implemented the feedback I received. Overall, I think
