       <p>
        Day of the Dead is a traditions that goes back thousands of years. It goes all the way back to the Meso-American civilazations of
        Central and Southern Mexico. The centerpiece of Day of the Dead is known as an
        <i>"ofrenda"</i>, 
        which I take great joy in
        putting together every year ! Ofrendas are not only a great way to honor the dead, but putting one together is also a great bonding 
        experience for the entire family ! For images and information on ofrendas please <a href = "https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/the-ofrenda-of-day-of-the-dead-museo-de-arte-popular/XQKSp6xep2BvIA?hl=en" target="_blank"</a>click here.</a>

        <b>The Bottom Tier</b> is the most practical. This is filled with candles, to light the way, and and also water so can 
        refresh themselves from the long journey. This tier, at times, may also include a basin and razor for washing and grooming upon
        arrival. The candles may also be decorated with pictures and embellisments.This is where you also find the Marigold flowers, as they
        are said to help lead the departed souls home.
   
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
    
        <b>The Second Tier</b> is used for favorite items, food, and drinks. This tier can include traditional foods such as tamales, sugarcane, fruit and 
        <a href="https://www.bhg.com/recipes/ethnic-food/mexican/what-is-pan-de-muerto/" target="_blank"><i>pan de muertos.</i></a> This is also where you would place their favorite
        alcoholic drink of choice. I put together an ofrenda for my brother, brother-in-law, and my uncle, and it always includes a few of their
        favorite beers.

         of when they were alive, sitting on the top tier along with various religious items. This is also where you would find the sugar skulls. 
         The sugar skulls which represent the departed soul. Sugar skulls also reflect the folk art style of big happy smiles,
         colorful icing, and sparkly tin and glittery adornments. Making the sugar skulls are a great
        family bonding experience. Try it for yourself !
